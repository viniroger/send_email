This email is an invitation to visit our website, called <strong>Monolito Nimbus</strong>. The site has been in existence since 2013 with the mission of disseminating knowledge through a scientific view of the world – <em>after all, life is not just a one subject only</em> – and promoting critical thinking. Its name is a reference to the monolith of the work "2001: a space odyssey", which is a tool to accelerate human development, and to meteorology, through the word nimbus – which is included in some cloud genres.<br>
So, visit <a href="https://www.monolitonimbus.com.br">MonolitoNimbus.com.br</a> =)
